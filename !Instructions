1. Introduction
The dj tool. product line was created as a tool for DJ’s, clubs, and event hosts to ease typical tasks for performances and shows within Second Life.   The dj tool. operates on a menu and notecard based system, created with simplicity and easy in mind.  The dj tool. has many uses including:

    1.    A request management system – listeners in the same sim can submit requests for the dj to view, delete, or to keep track of.
    2.    A announcement system – the dj can use a notecard inside of the tool to shout announcements periodically
    3.    A tip jar – a tip jar to keep track of how much a DJ has made during his gig.
    4.    Hovering title – a title to hover over the tool, which allows you to customize your own message to display.

The dj tool. series are sold with the following permissions: mod (allowing you to change the graphics on the panels, or the internal notecards but not the scripts), copy, no transfer.  This is done to allow the purchaser to retain a backup of the dj tool. in its original state. 

2. dj tool. Contents

The dj tool. has 14 items inside of it, 9 of these items are scripts required for the functionality of the dj tool;  3 of these items are notecards required to use the dj tool.  

Inside your dj tool. You should have the following 3 notecards:
    •    !Floating Text
    •    !Instructions
    •    !Shout

Inside your dj tool. You should have the following 9 scripts:

    •    !Users 
    •    Users

!Users is a editable notecard meant for the owner to add or remove users for the DJ tool.  Users is a script to manage multiple users. (See section 3e).

If any of these items are missing from your dj tool., it may not function properly. 

3. Features

There are several features in the dj tool. each feature is managed by specific notecards and menu systems (as detailed in the next section).  This feature section is to describe the notecards and each specific feature and how they work together.

a.  Announcement System (Shout)

The dj tool. has the ability to shout announcements within several timed intervals.  This system (referred to as Shout) displays the text in the “!Shout” Notecard .  Through the Shout menu, you can choose how often you want your announcements to be displayed (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 minutes), or turn the system off.  Anything in the notecard that contains two pound symbols (##) in the same line is not displayed.

Example:
## This line is not shouted
This line ## is not shouted either
Neither is this line ##

The displayed message can be as long or short as you want.

TIP: Most people dislike long announcements that are shouted often.  Short and informative messages are preferred.

Below is an example of how the !Shout notecard should look like:

## Place your announcement to be shouted below.  It Can be Multple Lines, ex:
## Welcome to The High
## Hope you enjoy your time here
## If you can, show your DJ some love :D
##-----------------------------------------
Welcome to The Club
Enjoy your time here
Remember to make a request type in /555 with your request
(ie. /555 Michael Jackson - Bad or /555 Any Michael Jackson!)

TIP:   A great way to use this system is to place any announcements, contest information that you would normally say or have other people shout. 

b. Request Management

Requests are managed through the 555 channel.  In order for a request to appear through the dj tool., they must be submitted with /555 before the request text.  Below are the correct ways to submit requests:

/555 Darude Sandstorm
/555 Darude
/555 Some punk music!
/555 Awesome music, have anymore jazz?

Below are incorrect ways to submit requests:

/5 Darude - Sandstorm
/55 Darude - Sandstorm
555 Darude Sandstorm
/request Darude Sandstorm

The request function of the dj tool., is always on, and requests can ONLY be seen by the owner of the dj tool. (in most cases the DJ).  When a request is processed, the name of the requester is attached (see below in section 7b, when discussing the Requests menu).

Requests can also be deleted from the queue as well.  Only the owner of the dj tool. can remove requests from the queue.  To remove a request, at any time, type in /555 delete and the request number.  Below are examples of how to properly remove requests: 

/555 delete 2
/555 delete 22
/555 delete 3

Below are examples of incorrect ways to delete requests

/55 delete 2
/555 delete 2 2
/555 delete Darude - Sandstorm

c. Floating text

Hovering text is controlled by the !floating text note card.  Text, placed in this notecard will display over the dj tool., in red lettering.  Any line that contains two pound sybmbols (##) in the same line will not be displayed, for example:

## This line is not be displayed
This line ## is not displayed either
Neither is this line ##

The !Floating Text notecard should look like the following:

## Place your floating text below.  Example:
## Nexeus Tip Jar
## -------------------------------------------
The DJ's Tip Jar!

You can display multiple lines of floating text by adding more lines in the notecard.  Here is an example: 

## Place your floating text below.  Example:
## Nexeus Tip Jar
## -------------------------------------------
Welcome to The Club
This is the DJ's Tip Jar!

d. Tip Jar

The dj tool. can also act as a tip-jar, sending any money to the owner or the current logged in user. 

Currently tips are not split (a feature planned to be implemented later).

e. Multiuser/Login
(available in any of the multiuser tools)

Multiuser has been added to the dj tool. tower since version 1.2 but only exists in specified products (generally any item that begins with DJ2).  Multiuser support requires a !User notecard and user script and supports up to 10 users (not including the item owner).  A users has the ability to run every aspect of the DJ tool except update the tool, only the owner is able to perform this funcation.

In order to add users, add them through the !User note card separating each name by a comma.  Example:

Nexeus Fatale, Phillip Linden

Note:  You can add as many names to the !User notecard, but only the first two names will be recognized.  Any names after the first ten will be disregarded. 

Multiuser support is based on a login system.  In order for the DJ tool to be operatable for a user, they must login.  This is done by simply clicking on the dj tool. and then selecting "Login" from the user menu.  Clicking on "Don't Login" prevents the user from login in.  A user is logged in until another user or owner logs in.
